Offer Brief — Safra Fácil (Pilot Wedge:
Drone Spraying Pilots — Brazil)
Potential Product Name Ideas
● Safra Fácil — Operações & Segurança
● Safra Fácil Pilot
● Safra Fácil: FlightShield (variant)
● Safra Fácil PRO (Piloto)
● Safra Fácil BlackBox
Level of consciousness
● Low → High: Target pilots are aware they have weather & liability problems but
unaware there's a simple, integrated software-first solution that solves both (so
messaging must educate + sharpen urgency).
Level of Awareness
● Problem Aware → Solution Curious
Pilots know wind, KP, and drift are risks. They search for “wind at altitude”, “drone
deriva”, “KP index GPS”. They will respond to concrete proof and tools that reduce
immediate risk.
Stage of Sophistication
● Early adopter / Pragmatic technophiles
They use DJI + Windy + WhatsApp but are frustrated with tool fragmentation. They
want something that works in the field, offline, and proves they did the right thing.
Big Idea
“Turn weather & regulatory risk into a business asset — one-click proof of safe flight.”
Safra Fácil doesn’t just show the weather; it captures and proves that you flew (or didn't)
under safe conditions — protecting your reputation, income and equipment.
Metaphor
“Your drone’s black box + agronomist in your pocket.”
Like a flight recorder for crop spraying — but smart, actionable, and built for the Brazilian
field.
Potential UMP (Unique Mechanism of the Problem)
● “Invisible altitude risk” — Traditional weather tools report ground-level or
wide-area forecasts; pilots face microclimate and altitude-specific winds (50–150m)
that aren’t visible and cause crashes/drift.
● Result: decisions made with the wrong data → financial & reputational loss.
Potential UMS (Unique Mechanism of the Solution)
● Immutable Flight Snapshots + Multi-Altitude Wind Layer
At “Start Operation”, Safra Fácil snapshots multi-altitude wind, KP, and local
conditions and stores a hashed record (audit-grade). Combine with predicted
spray-window traffic lights and one-click PDF “Proof of Safe Flight” for
farm/insurer/client.
Guru
Positioning voice: “The field-proven pilot’s partner.”
Tone: pragmatic, expert, Brazilian-rural fluent — not corporate-speak. Use pilot testimonials
& real ROI stories (short videos).
Discovery Story (Hero Narrative)
“João Silva was losing clients and nearly lost a R$150k Agras T30 when a sudden GPS
error caused a flyaway. After adopting Safra Fácil, João stopped guessing: the app warned
him of a KP spike and gust layer at 100m, he postponed the flight, and when he flew next
week the app generated a PDF report proving he acted responsibly — the farmer paid him
anyway, and João won two new contracts by proving professional standards.”
(Use a short video + one-sentence case study on the LP hero area.)
Product (short description)
A mobile-first Operations & Safety SaaS for Brazilian drone spraying pilots that:
● Provides multi-altitude wind & KP monitoring localized to the field,
● Generates one-click, audit-grade “Proof of Safe Flight” PDFs,
● Works offline with cached maps and sync,
● Stores flight logs, spray volumes, photos and pilot notes,
● Sends WhatsApp-ready summaries and compliance exports (MAPA/ANAC
templates).
Potential Headline / Subheadline Ideas
1. Headline: “Never be pressured into a risky flight again.”
Sub: “Know wind at flight height, track KP, and generate proof-of-flight reports in one
click.”
2. Headline: “Fly safe. Prove it. Get paid.”
Sub: “One platform for pre-flight checks, offline planning, and insurance-grade flight
logs.”
3. Headline: “The pilot’s black box for Brazilian fields.”
Sub: “Multi-altitude wind, geomagnetic alerts, offline mode — built for spraying.”
(Also prepare Portuguese variants for A/B testing.)
List all objections you can think of
● “It costs too much for a small margin business.”
● “I already use Windy / DJI / WhatsApp — why another app?”
● “Will it work without internet on the farm?”
● “Can it integrate (or not block) my DJI workflow?”
● “How accurate are your wind/KP data in microclimates?”
● “I don’t have time to learn another tool.”
● “What if it fails and I still crash?”
● “How secure is my data? Will you sell my client list?”
● “Do I need to register or upload sensitive info (insurance/legal risk)?”
● “Is the PDF/record sufficient for MAPA/insurer recognition?”
Belief Chains (what the prospect must believe to buy)
1. My operational risk (wind, KP, drift) is a real business threat.
2. Having documented proof of conditions reduces liability and increases client trust.
3. Integrated, pilot-focused software will save me time and protect revenue.
4. The tool’s data is reliable enough to base “go/no-go” decisions on.
5. The subscription cost is smaller than the expected avoided loss (drone crash, lost
contract, inspector penalty).
6. The app will work in my field conditions (offline mode, easy UI).
7. Other pilots I trust use it and recommend it.
Funnel Architecture (recommended)
1. Top (Awareness): Short-form verticals (Reels/TikTok) + targeted FB/Instagram ads
to pilots; headlines showing “One-click proof that saved my job” (Portuguese).
Promote pilot testimonials and short case videos.
2. Lead Magnet: Free downloadable “Sample Proof-of-Flight PDF” + checklist
“Pre-flight 60s Safety Routine” (Portuguese). CTA: WhatsApp opt-in or email.
3. Conversion Page (LP): Hero for Pilots only (single CTA): Try Free (14-day). Feature
demo video (60s), clear value (safety, reputation, reports), pricing anchor
R$49–99/mo. Include social proof and single CTA: “Start Free Trial / Get WhatsApp
Demo”.
4. Nurture / Activation: WhatsApp onboarding flow (immediate): set location → demo
generate PDF on pilot’s field (sample) → show offline map caching → prompt first
flight. Use in-app checklist to get quick “first win” (generate first report).
5. Revenue: Upgrade to Pro Pilot (R$49–99/mo) for unlimited PDF reports, WhatsApp
alerts, and flight database. Upsell Service Company tier (R$299/mo) for
multi-pilot/fleet.
6. Retention: Habit formation — daily WhatsApp audio brief (optional), flight history
badges, monthly safety leaderboard, and partner discounts (resellers/training).
7. Expansion: Marketplace (connect pilots to farmers) & insurance tie-in later.
Potential domains
● safrafacil.com.br (primary)
● safrafacilpilot.com.br
● safrafacil.io (tech perception)
● safrafacil.pro
Consider localized landing: pilotos.safrafacil.com.br
Examples / Swipes (copy & creative seeds)
● Ad swipe: “Perdeu um drone por confiar no vento de app? Com Safra Fácil, você vê
o vento a 100m e gera o PDF que prova que você fez tudo certo.”
● Email subject: “Seu relatório de pulverização — prova pronta em 60s”
● WhatsApp push: “Bom dia João — janela de pulverização hoje: 05:30–07:40. Gerar
relatório?”
● Landing hero CTA: “Teste grátis 14 dias — gera seu primeiro PDF em 3 minutos”
Other notes (go-to-market tactics & product specifics)
● Pilot-first product: Landing page must immediately split pilot vs farmer traffic;
prioritize pilot path.
● WhatsApp-first acquisition: Use WhatsApp opt-in as primary activation and
retention channel (pilots live there).
● Onboarding “quick win”: Require pilot to generate a sample PDF for their field
before trial ends — converts intent to value.
● Offline-first architecture: Sync when connection returns; local caching of maps &
weather snapshots.
● Regulatory partnerships: Explore MAPA/ANAC recognition or template exports to
increase credibility.
● Training & reseller channel: Bundle with local drone sellers and training schools
(include trial codes).
● Risk sharing: Consider a “pilot protection” program (partner with insurers) or trial
credit for pilots who prove usage.
● Pricing: Freemium (dashboard basic), Pro Pilot R$49–99/mo (reports + WhatsApp),
Service Co R$299/mo (team + API). Consider microtransaction option: buy-per-report
for very price-sensitive pilots.
