The Safra Fácil Belief Chain
1. The "Invisible Risk" Belief (The Problem)
"I believe that relying on standard weather apps (like Windy) is gambling
with my equipment, because they only show ground-level data and hide
the 'Invisible Altitude Risk' that destroys drones at 100 meters."
● Why this is necessary: If he believes Windy is "good enough," he has
no reason to switch. He must accept that his current tools are flawed
because they miss microclimates and altitude specifics. He needs to
acknowledge that "forecasts never match" the reality in the Cerrado.
2. The "Existential Threat" Belief (The Stakes)
"I believe that in today's competitive market, a single drift accusation or
crash isn't just an expense—it is a business-ending event that will destroy
my reputation and leave me with 'nobody to pay the loss'."
● Why this is necessary: He must move from viewing safety as a "chore"
to viewing it as "survival." This taps into his deep fear of "ruin" and the
anxiety that "if the drone crashes, nobody compensates me".
3. The "Immunity" Belief (The Mechanism)
"I believe that the only way to immunize myself against farmer blame and
liability is to possess indisputable, audit-grade 'Proof of Safe Flight' for
every single job."
● Why this is necessary: He needs to believe that documentation is his
shield. He must believe that "if I show a report, no one questions my
work" and that having proof "gets him out of trouble".
4. The "Professional Standard" Belief (The Identity)
"I believe that true 'Professional Pilots' do not guess; they use specialized
'Black Box' technology to guarantee safety, while only amateurs and
'unprepared people' rely on intuition."
● Why this is necessary: This leverages his pride. He hates "amateurs"
who ruin the market. To buy your product, he must see it as a badge of
his professional identity.
5. The "Feasibility" Belief (The Objection Killer)
"I believe that achieving this level of safety doesn't require complex tech
or 4G connection; it can be done in one click, offline, without disrupting
my workflow."
* Why this is necessary: If he thinks the tool is complicated or won't work
without internet (a major pain point ), he won't buy. He needs to believe it solves
his "fragmented tools" problem rather than adding to it.
6. The "Asymmetric ROI" Belief (The Justification)
"I believe that a small monthly subscription is a trivial price to pay for
'operational insurance' that protects my R$100k investment and secures
my future contracts."
* Why this is necessary: He is cost-conscious, so he must reframe the cost.
He needs to see the value in "recovering his investment" by avoiding a single
crash.
