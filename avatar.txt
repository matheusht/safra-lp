🚩 Key Challenges & Pain Points
1. Operational Safety & Weather Risk
○ Wind at spray altitude causing drift and crop damage.
○ Unexpected gusts and microclimates not predicted by standard weather apps.
○ Need for altitude-specific wind data (50–150 m).
2. Equipment Loss & Liability
○ Drone crashes / flyaways → huge financial loss (tens to hundreds of
thousands R$).
○ Being held responsible by farmers for drift/damage.
○ Limited or no insurance / slow claims process.
3. Fragmented Tools & Bureaucracy
○ Juggling multiple apps (weather, flight, mapping) that don't integrate.
○ Poor rural connectivity (offline problems).
○ Complex registration/compliance (ANAC/CAAR, MAPA) and paperwork
burden.
🌟 Goals & Aspirations
● Short-Term Goals:
○ Execute safe spray jobs this week without incident.
○ Reduce input waste (chemicals) per hectare.
○ Deliver proof (reports/photos) to the farmer to secure payment.
● Long-Term Aspirations:
○ Build a regional reputation as a reliable, professional pilot.
○ Scale to a small fleet (2–5 drones) and hire a helper.
○ Become the go-to contractor for cooperatives and large farms; increase
monthly revenue substantially.
