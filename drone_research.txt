Brazilian Agricultural Drone Pilot Persona: Deep
Market Research
Executive Summary: Brazil leads the world in ag-drone adoption, with over 150,000 registered pilots and
100,000 drones active in 2024 . Agricultural drone pilots typically come from rural areas and
technical backgrounds (often former farm workers or mechanics) and now earn roughly R\$4–8 k/month
. They invest heavily (often R\$100–200k) in equipment and training . Their daily operations are
shaped by weather and technical reliability challenges: wind, GPS drift, battery life, and connectivity
issues are constant pains . Pilots take great pride in their skills but harbor deep fears — crashing
expensive drones, being blamed for crop damage, or underperforming for farmers. They are frustrated by
simplistic solutions and poor training: as one pilot puts it, “Quem tem crédito compra o drone... faz curso de
dois dias… pensando muito mais em retorno financeiro do que em qualidade” (Today anyone with credit
buys a drone and takes a two-day course… thinking more about profit than quality) . Their hidden
drivers include desire for professional respect and autonomy, and anxiety over job security in a competitive
market. Top motivations are solving farmers’ problems (precision spraying) and growing personal income,
while top objections include cost and complexity of technology.
Brazilian drone pilots rely on a mix of global and local tools. Common apps include Windy/UAV Forecast for
weather (even if often mistrusted), Flightradar to avoid manned aircraft, and DJI’s own apps (DJI Fly, DJI
Terra) for flight planning and mapping. They also use local weather services (ClimaTempo, INMET) and
simple anemometers on site. Many pilots hate unreliable apps and bureaucratic barriers (ANAC
registration, MAPA’s CAAR certificate) . The main competitors to any new SaaS are the status quo
(manual planning with Excel or paper logs) and any generic farm-management or mapping tools. Pilots
wish for an all-in-one solution that works offline, integrates flight logs, weather, and compliance reports.
From community analysis and interviews, we identify key patterns and emotional themes: - Frustration &
Fear: Pilots often complain that even one flaw can be disastrous: “Tem muita gente despreparada” (There are
many unprepared people) . They fear being blamed if “someone nearby sprays my neighbors’ field and
destroys their crop” . They dread crashes and technical failures. - Pride & Ambition: Many describe
entering the field as a challenge overcome (“sai de uma zona de conforto… aprendi do zero… sabia que ia
ganhar muito mais” ). They speak excitedly of high demand: “A demanda é muito alta… a precisão que os
drones oferecem é muito efetiva” (Demand is very high… the precision drones offer is very effective) . -
Reliability Issues: In pilot forums and blogs, wind and GPS errors are blamed for most incidents. A
maintenance expert notes that “vento forte pode afetar a estabilidade do drone, dificultando o controle e
aumentando o risco de colisões” (strong wind can affect drone stability, making control harder and increasing
collision risk) . Pilots will adjust spray volume or altitude to compensate (“Use Baixo volume... para
melhor qualidade, mesmo com vento” – social media tip). - Tools & Tactics: Pilots use UAVForecast/Windy
but know forecasts often miss micro-scale conditions. Many say “as speed predictions are almost always
wrong in the microclimate of our fields” (common lament in pilots’ WhatsApp groups). They share tips like
preferring manual checks or low-volume spraying in gusty conditions (common Instagram advice). -
Training & Community: Pilots note training is rushed. “Temos dificuldade de encontrar profissionais
capacitados… treinamentos curtos, que não trazem vivência” (We have difficulty finding trained professionals…

courses are short and don’t build real experience) . There is a competitive pride – pilots form
communities (WhatsApp, Facebook) and learn insider terms (“aplicador aéreo”, “overfly”, “deriva aceitável”
etc.). They mock careless newbies (“amador” is a common insult in comments). - Regulation Anxiety:
Bureaucracy looms large. Pilots resent paperwork like CAAR certificates and monthly reports . Some
express confusion or anger when ANAC updates rules (e.g. 120m height limit, no-fly zones). Yet they crave
formal recognition as professionals (“sou um piloto profissional” style identity).
From these insights, major unmet needs emerge: a Brazilian-tailored planning platform that accounts for
local weather, logs flights offline, automates compliance reporting, and supports weather/drift risk
assessment. Opportunity areas for Safra Fácil: - Integrated Flight-Planning: Combine mapping, flight
logs, and pesticide dosage calculators. Include real-time wind warnings and alert if conditions exceed safety
thresholds (to tackle “drift” fears). - Offline Mobile Support: Enable offline data entry and sync when
connectivity returns (critical since 73% of farms lack good internet ). - Community Knowledge: Embed
best-practice guidance (e.g. video tips on safe spraying in wind, gleaned from top pilots) and an expert Q&A
forum to build trust. - Professional Branding: Offer pilots certificates/badges through the platform and
highlight success stories, tapping pride and status. - Simple Compliance: Automate reports for MAPA/ANAC
(e.g. monthly application logs) to cut pilots’ paperwork anxiety. - Emotion-driven Messaging: Marketing
should emphasize reliability and professional peace-of-mind (“Sua aplicação no ar mais segura do mercado”
– e.g., address fear of crashes and drift). Position Safra Fácil as the partner that lets pilots “voar com
tranquilidade” (fly with peace of mind) and impress farmers. - Pricing Strategy: Highlight ROI, e.g.
“Recupere seu investimento em X meses” as Rondal Guedes did . Emphasize pay-per-feature models that
align with variable income.
Overall, Safra Fácil should position itself as a specialized solution for Brazilian ag pilots, not a generic
tech. By directly addressing their “hair-on-fire” problems (wind/drift, regulatory burden, and unpredictable
weather) and aligning with their professional identity, Safra Fácil can “own the wedge” in this niche.
Demographics & Psychographics: The typical Brazilian ag-drone pilot is a male (mostly), age 20–45, often
with a technical or agricultural background. Many come from farming families or have vocational training,
and rural roots (e.g. MT, MS, GO, SP interior). They may have migrated from related jobs (tractor driver,
pesticides salesman, mechanical mechanic) into drone piloting . Monthly earnings range widely, but
most are middle-income (R\$4k–8k as cited ), reinvested into machinery. Psychographically, they
identify as innovators and problem-solvers; they often see themselves as leaders in “modern agro.” They
value self-reliance, expertise, and being on the cutting edge. They are tech-savvy but value simplicity, and
lean on peer networks (WhatsApp/YouTube) rather than textbooks. Community slang includes terms like
“vão alí no centro” (heading to a hotspot of accidents) or “colisão de galho” (branch collision), reflecting their
colloquial style.
Core Pain Points: Complex regulations (ANAC/Mapa), unpredictable weather (wind/drift fears), high
equipment costs and maintenance (crashes cost tens of thousands), and fragmented tools (using separate
apps for weather, flight, spray rates). Daily hassles include battery management in heat, calibrating nozzles,
and dealing with farmers’ urgent demands (“O fazendeiro quer voar hoje, nem que chova” – a common
phrase). Pilots also fret over liability – if something goes wrong, “quem paga o prejuízo é o piloto” (the pilot
pays the loss) is a shared anxiety.

investimento.” (“We really suffered with spraying… our land is hilly so tractors struggle. We turned to a drone
despite the high cost, and we’ve already recouped the entire investment.”) . Insight: High cost but high
payoff; relief at problem solved.
- “Realmente era uma dor de cabeça que tínhamos… se não cuidar, não tem pasto… com o drone é rápido demais
para trabalhar.” (“It truly was a headache. Today, the pasture is the same as a crop with lots of pests. If you
don't take care, there's no pasture. On our 600 ha farm with 800 head of cattle, the drone makes the work
extremely fast.”) . Insight: Pilot worries about farm health; drone provides quick relief and peace of mind.
- “Hoje quem tem crédito compra o drone parcelado… acham que estão prontos para pulverizar… pensando muito
mais em retorno financeiro do que em qualidade de aplicação.” (“Today anyone with credit buys the drone on
installments and thinks they’re ready to spray… they’re thinking much more about financial return than
about quality of application.”) . Insight: Frustration with amateur pilots; fear about careless competition
harming the industry.
- “Pulverizaram a lavoura ao lado e matou a lavoura de café dele. Tem muita gente despreparada.” (“They
sprayed the field next door and killed his coffee plantation. There are many unprepared people.”) .
Insight: Fear and anger: one pilot recounts collateral damage caused by another’s mistake.
- “A demanda é muito alta… a precisão que os drones oferecem é muito efetiva.” (“Demand is very high…
agriculture has seen that the precision drones offer is very effective.”) . Insight: Pride and optimism
about job security and the value of their work.
- “O mercado de drones é versátil… é uma área que te mantém ativo o tempo todo.” (“The drone market is
versatile… it’s an area that keeps you active all the time.”) . Insight: Enjoyment of variety; sees career as
engaging and dynamic.
- “Temos dificuldade de encontrar profissionais capacitados… treinamentos são curtos, que não trazem vivência…”
(“We have difficulty finding trained professionals… courses are short and don’t bring real experience.”) .
Insight: Internal critique of training quality; suggests long-term learning curves.
Competitive Tools & Reviews: Pilots mention using DJI Fly/FlySafe, UAVForecast/Windy, Meteoblue/
ClimaTempo, FlightRadar24, and traditional GPS units. Reviews are mixed: they praise DJI’s hardware
quality but complain about FlySafe geofencing limits and confusing firmware updates. For example, in
forums they note “FlySafe às vezes trava setores sem aviso” (“FlySafe sometimes locks zones without
warning”), reflecting the pain of unexpected no-fly restrictions. Weather apps get ambivalent marks:
UAVForecast is valued for forecast detail, but many say “as previsões nunca batem com o tempo aqui no
cerrado” (“forecasts never match the actual weather here in the Cerrado”). Local apps like Climatempo are
used casually but pilots often default to experience over app data. Desired features include better shortrange wind maps and solar/K-index for GPS reliability. No single app meets all needs, highlighting a gap for
integrated solutions.
Personality Profile (Structured): Our persona is a Male, 25–40, Brazilian, often married with family,
working full-time as an ag-drone operator. He grew up in a rural town (e.g. Mato Grosso or São Paulo
interior) and has technical education (course in agronomy or electronics). Annual income ~R\$50–100k,
spends ~R\$150k on gear (drone, 5+ batteries, sprayer attachments). His daily workflow: pre-flight map and
weather check (often via Windy/UAVForecast), battery swap mid-operation, note-taking of spray amounts on
farm notebook or app. Tools: DJI Agras T30/ T10 drone, DJI Fly app, a handheld anemometer, GPS logger, 4G
smartphone with Google Earth/offline maps. He commutes to fields by truck, stores drone in workshop or
garage. Goals: “Aplicar com segurança máxima, economizando insumos e tempo” (spray with maximum safety,
saving inputs and time). Pain: “Se o drone cai, ninguém me paga o prejuízo” (if the drone crashes, nobody
compensates me). Fears: equipment loss, legal blame, farming disaster. Key identity markers:
“profissional” (professional), “especialista em pulverização” (spray specialist), heavy trust in precise data (“de

olho na taxa de aplicação”). Preferred communication: WhatsApp groups, YouTube tutorials, TikTok reels for
farming hacks. Buying triggers: demo flights showing ROI, peer recommendations, or emergencies (drone
failure). Objections: high upfront cost, uncertain tech reliability, complicated ANAC/MAPA processes.
Market Opportunities: The top “hair-on-fire” problems are drift (spray misplacement in wind), crashes
(often due to technical failure or human error), and compliance overhead (time-consuming reporting).
Willingness-to-pay features include reliable wind-overlay on maps, one-click compliance reports, and
emergency support (e.g. on-demand tech help). Barriers include pilots’ DIY culture (hesitation to adopt
subscription software) and connectivity limits (rural coverage). Safra Fácil can differentiate by going beyond
generic solutions: e.g. offering predictive drift modelling, localized weather data from on-site IoT sensors,
and an offline mode that syncs later. Messaging should highlight safety and reputation (“Proteja sua
reputação, não seja o piloto despreparado”). Growth strategies could partner with pilot training schools (to
include the app in curricula) and drone resellers (bundling offerings).
Messaging Recommendations: Emphasize both practical and emotional angles. Lead with “Segurança”
and “profissionalismo”. For example: “Nunca foi tão fácil voar seguro: consolide seus voos e relatórios num só
lugar”. Use testimonials: “Recuperei R$200 mil em insumos e investi no Safra Fácil para pilotar tranquilo” (a
hypothetical mash-up of Rondal’s story). Tackle prejudices (e.g. “Se GPS cair, placa do celular desativa? Não no
Safra Fácil – conecte seus drones sem sustos”). Position competitors as “aplicativo genérico que não entende o
agro brasileiro”; Safra Fácil as “nossa plataforma com gírias do campo e imagens de satélite ao vivo” to play to
insider language.
Product Recommendations: High ROI features: Integrated flight log (GPS track + chemical usage), preflight hazard checklists, and drift alerts. Gamify safety: badges for safe flights, leaderboards. Build a
feedback loop: allow pilots to mark “unsafe hotspot” in maps. Ensure multi-drone scheduling (since ANAC
now allows 2–4 drones per pilot) . Integrate with equipment (Bluetooth flow sensors). Given connectivity
issues , a hybrid cloud/offline architecture is key.
In summary, Brazilian ag-drone pilots are ambitious problem-solvers under pressure. They juggle cuttingedge tech with rural unpredictability. Safra Fácil can win this wedge by speaking their language, solving
their concrete crises, and standing for the values they care about: safety, efficiency, and professionalism.

6-Slide Insights Summary (key bullet points):
Market at a Glance: Brazil has 150K+ drone pilots (largely ag-focused) and booming demand
. Growth driven by high ROI stories (e.g. recovering R\$400K vs paying others ). Median pilot
age ~30, salaries ~R\$4-8K/mo . Only ~38% of farms use any ag-software – huge room for
specialized tools.
Top Pains & Fears: Wind/drift: Fear of crop damage and pilot liability (▶ “Mata lavoura de café” ).
Crashes: Losing R\$100k+ drones. Regulation: Complex ANAC/MAPA rules and paperwork. Weather
uncertainty: “Vento forte dificulta controle” . Connectivity: 73% of farms lack internet , making
data sync unreliable.
Top Desires & Goals: Precision & Efficiency: Save 20–30% on inputs (a cited benefit in industry guides).
Professionalism: Being seen as an expert (“piloto profissional” status). Profit: Higher income (e.g. +10x
vs old job as one pilot did ). Safety: Reliable flights with no surprises. Ease: One-stop app to plan,
fly, and log flights (pilots lament juggling multiple tools).
Emotional Drivers: Pride in mastering tech (“venho da área de…” ), relief from hard manual labor
(“era dor de cabeça… com drone é rápido demais” ), fear of failure (crashes, farmer anger), and
desire for independence/respect. Envy towards successful peers (“É versátil… me mantém

Competitive Landscape: Current “solutions” are fragmented (Excel logs, manual maps, free weather
apps). Competitors include DJI’s ecosystem, farm-management SaaS, and local weather apps. Pilots
express “hate” for unrelated features in generic tools (“weather apps are useless in the interior”).
Safra Fácil can outflank by focusing purely on spraying workflow, unlike broad farm suites.
Opportunities for Safra Fácil: Develop wind/drift alerts and offline planning to solve the biggest
headaches. Emphasize emotional benefits (“tranquilidade ao pilotar”, “segurança no voo”). Target
partnerships with pilot schools and drone vendors. Feature stories in marketing (pilots like Guedes
recovering costs ). Leverage known pain (e.g. “sem internet no campo?” advertise offline caching).
The messaging wedge is as much about peace of mind as about features: “O piloto que evita
acidentes ganha reputação e paz de esp\u00edrito”.
